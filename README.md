# FitnessTracker
The 3D Workout Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help users track their workouts and visualize them in a 3D space using the Three.jslibrary. This project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging way for users to log their exercise routines and see them represented as various 3D shapes.
